v0.1.1  Quick Bugfix - Renamed the rake tasks file from "minify_extension_tasks"
        (the old working name) to "sns_minifier_extension_tasks" so we should be
        good there.  Thanks Tim Gossett for catching this one!

v0.1    Initial Release - Yay.  This came out quickly after Styles 'n Scripts
        version 0.5 and is pretty lean (read "no tests") but is also based on
        the work of others so should be pretty robust (or pretty flaky depending
        on your outlook).  Release early, release often, right?s
