  As a content editor
  I should be able to see a timeline
  And view previous versions of pages

    When I edit the page
    Then I should see a timeline
    And the timeline should have a chevron to indicate where I am
  
  Scenario: view timeline when viewing diff

    Given I have a page with more than one version
